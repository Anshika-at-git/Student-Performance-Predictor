# 🎓 Student Performance Predictor

This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict a student’s **final exam score (G3)** based on factors like their past performance, study habits, and attendance. I built this using the **UCI Student Performance Dataset**, this model helps identify students who might need extra support early on...

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance)
- File used: `student-mat.csv`

---

## 📊 Features Used
- 'G' – First test grade  
- 'G2' – Second test grade  
- 'studytime' – Weekly study time  
- 'absences' – Number of absences  

---

## 🎯 Target Variable
- 'G3' – Final exam grade (what we’re trying to predict)

---

## ⚙️ Technology Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data processing
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning (Linear Regression)

---

## 📈 Results
- ✅ **Model Used:** Linear Regression
- 📊 **R² Score:** '0.7822'  
  This means the model explains **~78%** of the variation in final exam scores — a strong fit for educational data!
